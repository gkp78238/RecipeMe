Must Do: 
1) Get Login and Signup Working on back end (loginForm.js)
2) Get Edit and remove buttons to work (userlist.js) 
3) add functionality to edit component options 
- for edit, you could make it display which ingredients you have and dont have, 
    and the api returns info like what aisle they are on, so we could have it make a shopping list automatically and that 
    could be what the user can edit? 
    -theres also an edit form component i started, would need to edit user component, editcomponent, and userList component and pass props also to the user profile that stores their cookbook
    - the other choice would be when we add it to the pantry, the description and ingredients become a text field, and all of the ingredients needed become displayed on the side 
    - here is the way the API response is formatted: https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Recipes-by-Ingredients
4) Make the search bar work better  (have it display and save what ingredients you've put in so far like the figma model?) 
5) make sure the cookbook saves when you log in and out 

Optional:
1) Put the recipe book and search on separate pages 
2) have the search return more than 3 resulta
3) have the search rank by number ingredients used (returned by API) 
4) make a shopping list with the aisle of all the missedIngredients (returned by API)
